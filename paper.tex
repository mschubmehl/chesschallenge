Successful algorithmic trading in the real world requires a deep knowledge of mathematical modeling,
high-performance computing, software and hardware design, optimization, and data analysis. Our
real-time chess prediction market aims to reproduce many of these fascinating challenges at a small
scale, encouraging students to synthesize knowledge from many disciplines. While it is simple enough
for talented high school students to get up and running quickly, the problem is sufficiently rich
that even gradutate students and seasoned industry veterans can happily spend hours trying to eke
out an edge over the competition.

\section{Introduction}

A prediction market is a mechanism that allows traders with diverse information sets to come
together to discover an event's probability. In our real-time chess prediction market, students are
tasked with writing an algorithmic trading engine that continuously predicts the probability white
will win a chess match, as it is multicast to them at approximately one move per second. A real-time
anonymized price feed containing all orders in the prediction market, plus any trades between
participants, is also multicast to them in real-time. If a student's forecast is above the
instantaneous market price, they can buy from their peers, and if it falls below the market price,
they can sell. When the game ends in a victory for white, whether by checkmate or concession, any
net sellers pay net buyers a virtual \$100 per contract. If the game ends in a draw or a win for
black, no further money changes hands, so that net buyers will have lost their purchase price, and
net sellers will have gained theirs. The game is zero sum, so that the total profit across all
players will equal zero.





\section{Details}

A prediction market is a mechanism that allows traders with diverse information sets to come
together to discover an event's probability. At its core, the market consists of a matching engine
that accepts orders from participants: buy 10 contracts at any price up to \$60, for example, or
sell 5 contracts at any price \$70 or higher. In many cases, the matching engine will not find a
counterparty for an incoming order, so it simply holds the order until a compatible order in the
other direction arrives. 

\section{Implementation}

feed parsing: chess and book (auto book building to make it easy, although this could be done faster)

pygame chess

stockfish

python multicast

python matching engine

python or c++ API

seed bots

\section{Results}

most participants began by copying the stockfish-based seed bot

Students at USACO training camp had only four hours to play (two training, two real). Were able to make some reasonable progress, but more time and higher experience level would have made it more fun. 

Machine learning benefits hugely. Most successful team was their coaches, who hooked up GNU Chess
and averaged its predictions with Stockfish. While they pursued this strategy, they clearly
dominated teams using Stockfish-only bots.

\section{Future Work}

Wider diversity of input bots (possibly including past competition code), especially that better illustrate points along the speed-vs-intelligence frontier.
